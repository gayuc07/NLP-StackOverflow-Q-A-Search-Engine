# Retrieval of Relevant Answers to Stack Overflow Queries by Ranking the Answers - Python

Stack Overflow is a question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers. It provides a platform for its users to post questions and answers. It also allows its users to upvote or downvote these questions and answers. Stack overflow has a wide range of questions and challenges faced by developers and their solutions in the computer engineering field. As per the Stack Overflow survey 2019, around 97% of developers visited the Stack Overflow website last year. And about 50 million people visit Stack Overflow to learn, share, and build their careers every month.

Although this forum offers numerous advantages for developers, on the flip side there are few drawbacks associated with it. Sometimes Stack overflowâ€™s search engine does not retrieve any results even if a similar question exists in the repository. And as stack overflow allows duplicate questions and each question has a different set of answers many users find it difficult to get relevant answers to their queries. As the main source of revenue for stack overflow is through advertising these are the advantages to drive more traffic. However, the problem arises when users use more sophisticated search engines like google and these search engines redirect the user to other sites. Hence to overcome these gaps this project aims at improving Stack Overflow search using semantic similarity between questions & answers and retrieving the most relevant answers using a ranking methodology.
